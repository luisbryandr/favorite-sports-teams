//Future stretch! but i really want: 
//  ability to add to my calendar and set reminder or text me the infor day before the next game or something like that - I want to able to forget about and get only my favorite teams games to me for reference.


//Future/ Stretch:  Add ability for user to look for their favorite team by name using this api call as an example (https://v3.football.api-sports.io/teams?name=manchester united()

//Future/ Stretch: Ability to create user profiles (will need a back end to store crednetials or outsource this and use back end only to store preferences / api calls they make  database with their favorite teams info (id, logo, etc))

//Going to need to add an x button to take out a searched team from state to stop displaying

//need to fix styling for responsiveness for really small screens it breaks at less than 790px
